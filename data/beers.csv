The gravity of the wort was a little higher than expected, owed to the efficiency of the brewhouse and the Daytime mash profile. Fermentation went very well and the beer finished out in about 3 days, also at a lower F.G. than expected. As a result the alcohol was indeed higher than expected, in fact the lab results just came in and our Brown Ale is 5.5% ABV. We did in fact choose Simcoe and Nelson Sauvin for the dry hop, but we also included two more of our favorites, the elusive and rare Citra and and the ever sexy Mosaic (dry hopped at 1.6 lbs/BBL). After 3 days of extraction, 2 days of cooling, and another 2 days cold stable, the beer was filtered bright last night (July 31st), and packaged this morning (August 1st). The beer is decidedly dry and drinkable, with the impressive bouquet of hop aromas and resinous kettle hop being the main event.

Gordon is a hybrid version of strong ale, somewhere between an Imperial Red and a Double IPA. We make it with six different malts and three types of hops, then dry-hop it with a mutha lode of Amarillo hops.

It features a gooey, resiny aroma and a luscious mouthfeel. Gordon is brewed with dash of chocolate malt in it, to round out its load of hops and balance the beer. The result is an assertive yet exceptionally smooth version of strong beer.

We brew Gordon in tribute to the late Gordon Knight. In addition to opening some of Colorado's first microbreweries, Knight was a Vietnam vet, grade-A citizen, and huge promoter of craft beer. He lost his life in 2002 while fighting a wild fire outside of Lyons, Colorado.

Originally our winter seasonal beer, it has become a cult favorite of extreme-beer lovers, so we now brew occasional batches of Gordon throughout the year. Released in bottles in 2003 and 2004, Gordon is now sold in four packs of hand-labeled cans and on draft in select markets.",8.7,f,f,https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/69R1Vd/upload_Ze6ZJK-contentAwareIcon.png,https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/69R1Vd/upload_Ze6ZJK-contentAwareMedium.png,https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/69R1Vd/upload_Ze6ZJK-contentAwareLarge.png
